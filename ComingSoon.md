# What's next?

We are adding a ui with more compatibilty such as csv to json, json to csv.
We will also be working on not just csv but formats like pdf to png or png to jpeg.
Even though these are simple it will be a nice start to an amazing program.

# Why use it?

Well to be completely honest, this code could be considered a gimmick and complicated but in the next couple of months, the code will be fixed.

# When will it release?

June 2nd 2023.
